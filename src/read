WebRTC
How Web Real time communiation works:
[1] User 'A' open page with WebRTC content
[2] Browser asking (if neccesery) for an microphone and camera access
[3] SDP package initing
    SDP package is text based package wich include all must-have parameters
    for connecting to 'A' (codecs,addrs.etc.)
[4] Transpoting SDP to user 'B'  by WebSocket + Signal Server
[5] User 'B' takes SDP package and make simple SDP package, but with depence
    on data from 'A' SDP
[6] Network monitoring, getting outter IP-addres of clients by getting them
    STAN-server addres
    [1] checking outter IP-addres with inner client addres for understand:
    in this system NAT-server or not. If NAT, we have to understand, how 
    UDP packages transporting inside. 
    [2] Some times in systems used Double NAT server, so in this case in system
    used TURN server, not STAN. (Needs to remake P2P connection to client-server)
[7] Done, if everything ok, we are connected, sometimes in system will rings 
    onicecandidate event, it contains information about NAT-settings, IP-addrs, 
    attempts to connect etc.
